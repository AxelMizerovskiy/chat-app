# TCP Server-Client Chat App

Currently just has commnication between 2 clients but its synched.

Sends user message to the second user and also prints it on server.

To fix: 

-currently the app needs both users to send for messages to update

-client 1 only receives the first word of client 2's message

-connection isnt established untilm  both users are attempting to make contact with server

To add:

-Maybe ask the people for their names at the intial contact

-Later on will be key encrypted.

-for the encryption use SLL and you can use cloudfare to get it free

-Will be wrapped into a android java app with kotlin with C++ to handle comms.
